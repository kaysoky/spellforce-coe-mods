Demonologist Replacement
    Uses Alchemist crafting to translates lesser demons into souls
        Lesser Demons are Artefacts and have levels - Souls are Items and don't have levels
            No straightforward translation from Lesser Demon into Souls
        Instead, level 3 lesser demons add extra loot drops (Sacrificial Offerings) associated with themselves
            Can't retain Cult info this way, but better than nothing
        3x Sacrificial Offerings = Lesser Demonic Vessel
            Equivalent to a level 2 Lesser Demon + Soul Cage
        3x Lesser Demonic Vessels = Medium Demonic Vessel
        3x Medium Demonic Vessels = Greater Demonic Vessel
        (TODO) 3x Greater Demonic Vessels = Ultimate Demonic Vessel (Replacement for Greater Demons via Amalgamation)
    Uses Necromancer crafting to summon demons

    Necromancer-like army size
        Remove 1 stackslot, but add 2 dedicated to Tier 1 units
Demonologist Grimoire Page
    Ritual Chamber -> Unlocks Demonology, Alchemy, and Necromancy
    Hire Cultist -> Summon chaff (random Tier 1 unit)
    Eager Mind -> Soul Cage (Necromancer ability)
    Amalgamation Chamber -> Soul Well (Necromancer one)
-vv- TODO -vv-
    Banish Demon -> Sully Village ability (urban tile -> sullied village = negative reputation each turn + weekly Demonic Vessel income)
        See Galtrak's abilities
Occultism spell replacements
    Sacrificial Summon -> ???
    Greater Sacrificial Summon -> ???
    Infused Memory -> ??? Might be fine as-is
    Chaos Altar & Shrine -> Provides weekly income instead of hiring demons
    Pandemonium -> Higher stat buff instead of hiring demons
Lesser Demon Rebalance
    Vulture
        All level 3 lesser demons effectively gain +1 mana per battle, so Vulture's bonus not as good
        Adds extra Allfire income per turn
    Arbiter
        Allfire income too high for Soul form, reduced to 2
-^^- TODO -^^-
    Paradox
        Execute threshold too strong, reduced to 25%
