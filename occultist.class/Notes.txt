    Pandemonium -> Higher stat buff instead of hiring demons
Cities are spawners
    Haven't had success doing so...
    Mostly focused on guarding, but will ambush at lowest reputation
    Sully Village gives Siege City ability too?
New equipment slot for Cult?
    Cult crafting recipe?  Does a blank work?
Lesser Demon Rebalance
    Vulture
        All level 3 lesser demons effectively gain +1 mana per battle, so Vulture's bonus not as good
        Adds extra Allfire income per turn
    Arbiter
        Allfire income too high for Soul form, reduced to 2
-^^- TODO -^^-
    Paradox
        Execute threshold too strong, reduced to 25%
